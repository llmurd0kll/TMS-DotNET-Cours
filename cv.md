Some words about my TMS course goals.
------
 Firstly i would like to lern OOP because it's a key knowledge. The most important goal is to learn C# and .Net then get different practical skills and the ability to use them during creating code as well as practically apply them in the work prosses as quickly as possible. Then it would be nice to find a job after my graduation.
